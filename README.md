its my frp project for future ready talent
i created a gym website and hosted it on azure virtual machine
i also used azure bot in it,first i created QnA maker and knowledge base then i created chatbot and embeded it into website code.

i am also using azure advisor for recommendation regarding cost and security,performance.
i am using a network security group for my virtual machine.
