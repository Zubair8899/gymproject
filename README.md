# gymproject
its my frp project for future ready talent
i created a gym website and hosted it on azure virtual machine
i also used azure bot in it,first i created QnA maker and knowledge base then i created chatbot and embeded it into website code.
i am using a virtual machine scale set for scaling out and to balance load if incase my cpu threshold gets high.for testing purpose i am using heavyload application to test scale set.
i am also using azure advisor for recommendation regarding cost and security,performance.

i am going to delete virtual machine after making a video and i will not delete azure bot so i am pasting github page link to checkout my project:https://zubair8899.github.io/gymproject/
